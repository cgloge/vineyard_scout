# Vineyard Scout
A **Keras / TensorFlow** model that predicts whether a piece of land is suitable for growing wine grapes. It's currently limited to California, but could easily be expanded to other locations.

If you want to generate your own data using the Google Maps API & WeatherBit API, you'll need to create a file called config.py which includes the following variables:

```
#Google maps API key
gmap_key = ''

#Weatherbit  API key
wbit_key = ''
```
